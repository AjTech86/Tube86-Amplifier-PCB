Mount all the 1/4 watt resistors but mount R10 and R28 on the underside of the PCB. R3 is 
no longer fitted. Mount IC1 and the 8 pin socket and the FET. Mount R16 and R29 and the 
capacitors except the elecrolytics (including C4 and C12) Mount the valve bases pushing them
home well making sure that the centre spigots are soldered to the centre grounding rings just
above R10 and R28. 

FITTING THE LEDS
 
Ream out the spigots of the valve bases with a 3mm drill and/or a thin electrical screwdriver 
and file down the ridge/collar on the lower part of the green leds - without exposing the anode 
connections at the base - until they can be pushed into the valve bases and sit flush with the
top of them ensuring their leads come out the other side . Turn the board over and push a 
short lenghth of sleeving (heatshrink will do) down the shorter anode lead. The cathode doesn't
matter as it goes to GND anyway by soldering it to the spigot after bending it over the same. The 
anode lead is then soldered to the left hand side of R10 or R28 whichever the case may be.

TESTING THE LEDS

With the positive lead of a testmeter connected to TP4 or TP6 or pin 7 of the valve bases and 
the negative to GND, if all is well the leds will light up.
Once the leds have been tested and are OK then R6 and R22 can be fitted. Mount the buzzer
and the 4 x 2 pin terminal connectors. Mount R13  and R27 on the underside of the PCB. Mount
all the electrolytic capacitors on the underside of the PCB as well - this is to shield them from the
heat generated by the valves. Mount VR1 and VR2 underneath too or they will work backwards.
