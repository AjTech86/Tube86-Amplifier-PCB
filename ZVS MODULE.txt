                                             ZVS BOOST CONVERTER MODULE

               I powered the amplifier with two of these modules â€“ one for each channel. 
               Connect the 20 volt supply to " IN " and a 15watt fridge lamp to the output
	and adjust to 220 volts or as near as you can get. Disconnect the lamp. Remove 
	the link on the "on/off pins", if there is one, and with some cutters cut down the
	one furthest from the heatsink leaving enough to solder a thinwire to of about 12 
	cms long. A spare Dupont cable will do for this. This wire will eventually connect
 	to one of the "shut down" points on the main PCB. Repeat all the above for both 
	modules. They seemed to run hotter than I liked and it was not the FETs or their 
	heatsinks that were doing this but the transformers. So I fixed heatsinks 20mm 
	square to the top of them with cable ties after applying  some heatsink compound. 
	I found that if I used thin ones (of the right length) and with a bit of jiggling they
               would deflect off the heatsink and up and over the top of the transformer. Maybe I 
	was being over cautious by doing this but for reliability I'd rather err on the safe 
	side. The modules can be put to one side now until the PCB is completed.
