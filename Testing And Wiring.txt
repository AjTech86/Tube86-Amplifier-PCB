  When the PCB is complete connect your 20 volt power supply. With a testmeter connected
  between TP1 and GND (the track across the board under B1+ and B2+ is GND) 
  should read 19/20 volt approx. Then check between TP2 and GND and it should read
  5 volts or thereabouts. TP3 should read 3.4/3.5 volts. Disconnect the power and 
  solder 2 wires 18cms long to the 10 watt auto bulb and solder them temporarily to 
  pins 4 and 5 of V2 valve base on the underside of board and put it inside cup or similar
  so as not dazzle your eyeballs or start afire!! Reconnect the power and measure between
  TP1 and TP5 and it should read 13.2 volts approx. Remove the auto bulb. Insert the
  valves and recheck the voltage is still 13.2.
  Connect the output V+ and GND of the ZVS power modules to B1+ and B2+ and GND on
  the PCB and the wires previously soldered to one of the " on/off " pins on the ZVS modules.
  The output transformer primary connections will go to LT1 and LT2 for Left Channel and 
  RT1 and RT2 for the Right Channel. The secondary connections will go to the loudspeakers
  and also to the L-FB and R-FB feedback pads on the PCB. If a loud whistling or screeching
  occurrs when powering up then reverse the feedback connections or the primary connections.  
  Input goes to L-IN and R-IN and GND at the front of the board.
